# Postgres-release Acceptance Tests (PGATS)

The acceptance tests run several deployments of the postgres-release in order to exercise a variety of scenario:
- Verify that customizable configurations are properly reflected in the PostgreSQL server
 - Roles
 - Databases
 - Database extensions
 - Properties (e.g. max_connections)
- Test supported upgrade paths from previous versions

You can run PGATS in two ways:
* [locally](#running-pgats-locally)
* [as BOSH errand](#running-pgats-as-bosh-errand)

## Running PGATS locally

### Environment setup

* Upload to the BOSH director the latest stemcell and your dev postgres-release:

```
bosh upload stemcell STEMCELL_URL_OR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_STEMCELL
bosh create release --force
bosh upload release
```

* The acceptance tests are written in Go. Make sure that:
 - Golang (>=1.7) is installed on the machine
 - the postgres-release is inside your $GOPATH

* PGATS must have access to the target BOSH director and to the postgres VM deployed from it.
If you are testing using a bosh-lite, make sure youâ€™ve run `bin/add-route` to setup routing rules.

* Tests make use of BOSH v2 manifests.
Make sure that the BOSH director is configured with the [cloud_config.yml](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html#update).

* PGATS use bosh-cli director package for programmatic access to the Director API.
It requires the Director to be configured with verifiable [certificates](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs.html).


### Configuration

An example config yml for bosh-lite would look like:

```
cat > pgats_config.yml << EOF

The full set of config parameters is explained below.

`bosh`parameters are used to connect to the BOSH director that would host the test environment:
* `bosh.target` (required) Public BOSH director ip address
* `bosh.username` (required) Username for the BOSH director login
* `bosh.password` (required) Password for the BOSH director login
* `bosh.director_ca_cert` (required) BOSH director CA Cert

`cloud_config` parameters are used to generate a BOSH v2 manifest that matches your IaaS configuration:
* `cloud_config.default_azs` List of vailability zones. It defaults to `[z1]`.
* `cloud_config.default_networks` List of networks. It defaults to `[{name: private}]`.
* `cloud_config.default_persistent_disk_type` Persistent disk type. It defaults to `10GB`.
* `cloud_config.default_vm_type` VM type. It defaults to `m3.medium`.

Other paramaters:
* `postgres_release_version` The postgres-release version to test. If not specified, the latest uploaded to the director is used.
* `postgresql_version` The PostgreSQL version that is expected to be deployed. You only need to specify it if your changes include a PostgreSQL version upgrade.
If not specified, we expect that the one in the latest published postgres-release is deployed.


### Running

Run all the tests with:

```
PGATS_CONFIG=[pgats_config.yml] <postgres-release>/src/acceptance-tests/scripts/test
```

Run a specific set of tests with:

```
PGATS_CONFIG=[pgats_config.yml] <postgres-release>/src/acceptance-tests/scripts/test <some test packages>
```

The `PGATS_CONFIG` environment variable must point to the absolute path of the [configuration file](#configuration)


## Running PGATS as BOSH errand

### Environment setup

* Upload to the BOSH director the latest stemcell and your dev postgres-release:

```
bosh upload stemcell STEMCELL_URL_OR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_STEMCELL
bosh create release --force
bosh upload release
```

* Tests make use of BOSH v2 manifests. 
Make sure that the BOSH director is configured with the [cloud_config.yml](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html#update).

* PGATS use bosh-cli director package for programmatic access to the Director API. 
It requires the Director to be configured with verifiable [certificates](https://bosh.io/docs/director-certs.html).

* Install spiff on your dev machine. 
Please refer to [Spiff documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/spiff#installation)


### Running

Create a properties stub to match your BOSH director and your IaaS configuration.
Use the stub to generate a BOSH v2 manifest for a postgres-release acceptance test errand job deployment.

bosh run errand acceptance-tests
```
